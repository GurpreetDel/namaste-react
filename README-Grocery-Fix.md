# Grocery Component Visibility Issue - Fix Documentation
*Timestamp: June 12, 2023 15:30 UTC*

## Issue Description
The Grocery component is not visible when clicking on the "Grocery" link in the navigation. This is because the component is being rendered behind the fixed header.

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the codebase, I found that:

1. The Header component is fixed at the top of the page with CSS properties:
   ```css
   .header {
       position: fixed;
       top: 0;
       left: 0;
       right: 0;
       height: 80px;
       z-index: 1000;
   }
   ```

2. The Body component has a margin-top to push it below the fixed header:
   ```css
   .body {
       margin-top: 100px;
       /* other styles */
   }
   ```

3. However, the Grocery component doesn't have any margin or padding to push it below the fixed header, causing it to be hidden behind the header when rendered.

## Solution
To fix this issue, we need to add appropriate CSS styling to the Grocery component to ensure it's visible below the fixed header. Here are the changes needed:

### 1. Add CSS Class to Grocery Component
Modify the Grocery component to include a CSS class:

```jsx
const Grocery = () => {
    return(
        <div className="grocery-container">
            <h1>
                {" "}
                Grocery Online Store and we have lot of child components
                inside this web page
            </h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Grocery;
```

### 2. Add CSS Styling
Add the following CSS to your index.css file:

```css
.grocery-container {
    margin-top: 100px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
}
```

This will:
- Add a top margin of 100px to push the content below the fixed header
- Add some padding for better visual appearance
- Set a background color for visual distinction

## Alternative Solution
If you prefer not to modify the component structure, you could also add a global CSS rule that applies to all main content components:

```css
.app > *:not(.header) {
    margin-top: 100px;
}
```

This would ensure that all direct children of the app container (except the header) have a top margin.

## Testing
After implementing these changes, the Grocery component should be visible when clicking on the "Grocery" link in the navigation. The content will be properly positioned below the fixed header.
