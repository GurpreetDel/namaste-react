# Restaurant Card Visibility Enhancement

## Problem Description

The restaurant cards were not properly visible in full length when running the application on localhost. The cards appeared too small, and the restaurant images were not maximized. The user wanted larger cards with maximized restaurant images, similar to the Swiggy.com website.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, we identified the following issues:

1. **Card Size Limitations**: 
   - The `.res-card` class had a fixed width of 24.5% and height of 320px, which was too small for proper visibility.
   - The restaurant images were set to a height of 220px, which didn't maximize the visual impact.

2. **Layout Constraints**:
   - The `.res-container` class used a very small gap (0.3%) between cards, causing them to be squeezed together.
   - The layout displayed 4 cards per row, making each card relatively small.

3. **Text Handling Issues**:
   - The text elements in the `RestaurantCard` component had `textOverflow: "ellipsis"` and `whiteSpace: "nowrap"` which truncated text rather than allowing it to wrap properly.

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to enhance the card visibility:

### 1. Increased Card Size

```css
.res-card {
    width: 100%;
    height: 380px;
    /* other properties remain the same */
}
```

- Changed the width from 24.5% to 100% (relative to its container)
- Increased the height from 320px to 380px

### 2. Enhanced Image Size

```jsx
<img
    src={/* image source */}
    style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "280px",
        objectFit: "cover",
        /* other properties remain the same */
    }}
    alt={/* alt text */}
/>
```

- Increased the image height from 220px to 280px

### 3. Improved Layout

```css
.res-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 2%;
    /* other properties remain the same */
    row-gap: 30px;
}

.res-container a {
    width: 32%;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: inherit;
    display: block;
}
```

- Increased the gap between cards from 0.3% to 2%
- Increased the row gap from 20px to 30px
- Changed the Link component width from 24.5% to 32%, resulting in 3 cards per row instead of 4
- Added `display: block` to ensure the Link takes up the full width

### 4. Better Text Handling

```jsx
<h3 style={{
    /* other properties */
    fontSize: "18px",
    whiteSpace: "normal",
    minHeight: "24px"
}}>
    {/* restaurant name */}
</h3>

<h4 style={{
    /* other properties */
    fontSize: "14px",
    whiteSpace: "normal",
    minHeight: "20px",
    lineHeight: "20px"
}}>
    {/* cuisine information */}
</h4>
```

- Changed `whiteSpace` from "nowrap" to "normal" to allow text wrapping
- Increased font sizes for better readability
- Added `minHeight` to ensure consistent spacing

### 5. Consistent Shimmer Effect

```css
.shimmer-card {
    width: 32%;
    height: 380px;
    /* other properties remain the same */
}

.shimmer-img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 280px;
    /* other properties remain the same */
}
```

- Updated the shimmer card dimensions to match the new restaurant card dimensions
- Updated the shimmer image height to match the new restaurant image height

## Before and After Comparison

### Before:
- Small cards with limited visibility
- 4 cards per row, each taking up 24.5% of the container width
- Restaurant images at 220px height
- Text truncated with ellipsis
- Small gaps between cards (0.3%)

### After:
- Larger cards with enhanced visibility
- 3 cards per row, each taking up 32% of the container width
- Restaurant images at 280px height (27% increase)
- Text allowed to wrap naturally
- Larger gaps between cards (2%)

## Conclusion

The implemented changes significantly enhance the visibility of restaurant cards, making them larger and more prominent. The restaurant images are now maximized, and the overall layout is more spacious and visually appealing, similar to the Swiggy.com website.

These improvements ensure that:
1. Cards are properly visible in full length
2. Restaurant images are maximized
3. Text content is fully readable
4. The overall user experience is enhanced

The solution maintains the responsive nature of the application while providing a more visually appealing presentation of restaurant information.
