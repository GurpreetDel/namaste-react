# Daywise Learning Documentation

This folder contains day-by-day documentation of what we've learned during the Namaste React course and how we've resolved various problems encountered along the way.

## Structure

Each day has its own folder with the naming convention `day-DD-month-YYYY` (e.g., `day-05-june-2025`). Inside each day's folder, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file documenting:
  - What we learned that day
  - Problems encountered and their solutions
  - Code examples and explanations

## Purpose

This documentation serves several purposes:

1. **Track Progress**: Keep a record of our learning journey through the React course
2. **Problem-Solving Reference**: Document solutions to problems for future reference
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share insights and learnings with team members
4. **Learning Reinforcement**: Reinforce learning by documenting concepts in our own words

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific day you're interested in
2. Read the README.md file to understand what was learned and what problems were solved
3. Use the code examples and explanations to help with similar issues you might encounter
