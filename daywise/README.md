## Recent Issues

### June 5, 2025: Restaurant Menu Display Issue

**Problem**: When clicking on a restaurant card, the restaurant details and menu were not displaying.

**Solution**: Fixed the dependency array in the useEffect hook and implemented more flexible data access patterns to handle different API response structures.

**Documentation**:
- [Day 5 June 2025 README](./day-05-june-2025/README.md): Comprehensive explanation of the issues and solutions.
- [Restaurant Menu Not Displaying - Technical Analysis](./problems-encountered/RestaurantMenu-NotDisplaying.md): Detailed technical analysis of the issue.

## Best Practices Learned

1. **React Hooks Best Practices**:
   - Always include all dependencies in the useEffect dependency array.
   - Be mindful of the dependency array to avoid infinite loops or stale data.

2. **API Data Handling**:
   - Implement flexible data access patterns to handle different API response structures.
   - Provide fallbacks for missing data to ensure a good user experience.
   - Add comprehensive logging to help debug issues.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
   - Use conditional rendering to handle undefined or null values.
   - Provide meaningful feedback to users when data is unavailable.

## Future Improvements

1. **API Response Normalization**: Implement a normalization layer that converts the API response into a consistent format.
2. **Error Boundary Implementation**: Add React Error Boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully at the component level.
3. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to verify that components handle different API response structures correctly.
