# How to Check Your Tailwind CSS Version - 10-06-2025

## Methods to Check Tailwind CSS Version

### Method 1: Using npm list command

The most direct way to check your installed Tailwind CSS version is using the npm list command:

```powershell
npm list tailwindcss
```

This command will display the installed version of Tailwind CSS in your project. Example output:

```
namaste-react@1.0.0 C:\Users\alokk\WebstormProjects\namaste-react
└── tailwindcss@4.1.8
```

If you want to see all Tailwind-related packages, you can use:

```powershell
npm list | findstr tailwind
```

Example output:

```
├── @tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.8
├── @tailwindcss/vite@4.1.8
└── tailwindcss@4.1.8
```

### Method 2: Check package.json

You can also check your project's package.json file to see the version of Tailwind CSS that's specified in your dependencies or devDependencies:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "tailwindcss": "^4.1.8"
}
```

Note that the actual installed version might be slightly different due to the caret (^) which allows for compatible updates.

### Method 3: Check node_modules directly

You can look at the package.json file inside the tailwindcss package in your node_modules directory:

```powershell
type .\node_modules\tailwindcss\package.json | findstr version
```

Example output:

```
  "version": "4.1.8",
```

## Why Knowing Your Tailwind CSS Version Is Important

Knowing your Tailwind CSS version is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Breaking Changes**: Tailwind CSS 4.x introduced significant breaking changes compared to version 3.x, including:
   - Moving the PostCSS plugin to a separate package (`@tailwindcss/postcss`)
   - Moving the Vite plugin to a separate package (`@tailwindcss/vite`)
   - Changes to the configuration API

2. **Documentation Reference**: Different versions have different features and syntax. When following tutorials or documentation, you need to ensure you're looking at the correct version's documentation.

3. **Troubleshooting**: Many errors can be version-specific. Knowing your version helps in finding the right solutions when troubleshooting.

4. **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with other tools and libraries in your project.

## Tailwind CSS 4.x Package Structure

In Tailwind CSS 4.x, the package structure has been modularized:

- `tailwindcss`: The core package
- `@tailwindcss/postcss`: The PostCSS plugin
- `@tailwindcss/vite`: The Vite plugin
- Other integrations in their own packages

This means that depending on your build tools, you might need to install and configure multiple Tailwind-related packages.

## Updating Tailwind CSS

If you need to update your Tailwind CSS version:

```powershell
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```

If you're using Tailwind CSS 4.x, remember to also update related packages:

```powershell
npm install @tailwindcss/postcss@latest
```

## Conclusion

Checking your Tailwind CSS version is a simple but important step in maintaining your project. By using the methods described above, you can quickly determine which version you're using and ensure you're following the appropriate documentation and best practices for that version.
