# Offline Detection Issue - Technical Analysis

## Error Description
The application was not displaying the offline message "Looks like you are offline!! Please Check your internet connection" when the user's browser was set to offline mode in the network tab of the developer console.

## Technical Root Cause

### Issue 1: Incomplete Event Handling in useOnlineStatus Hook

```javascript
// Before: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("offline", () => {
        setOnlineStatus(false);
    })
}, []);
```

**Problem**: The hook was only listening for the "offline" event but not the "online" event. This meant that while the application could detect when the user went offline, it couldn't detect when the user came back online.

**Impact**: The offline message would not be displayed consistently, and the application wouldn't recover properly when the connection was restored.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Initial State

```javascript
// Before: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useState(true);
```

**Problem**: The hook was initializing the `onlineStatus` state to `true` regardless of the actual network status. This meant that if the application was loaded while the user was already offline, it would incorrectly show the online state.

**Impact**: Users who were already offline when loading the application would not see the offline message until they toggled their connection status.

### Issue 3: Missing Cleanup for Event Listeners

```javascript
// Before: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("offline", () => {
        setOnlineStatus(false);
    })
}, []);
```

**Problem**: The hook was not removing the event listeners when the component unmounted. This could lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior if the component was mounted and unmounted multiple times.

**Impact**: Potential memory leaks and duplicate event handlers being registered, which could cause performance issues.

## Solution Implementation

### Fix 1: Add Event Listener for Online Event

```javascript
// After: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
useEffect(() => {
    // Event handler functions
    const handleOnline = () => {
        setOnlineStatus(true);
    };

    const handleOffline = () => {
        setOnlineStatus(false);
    };

    // Add event listeners for both online and offline events
    window.addEventListener("online", handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener("offline", handleOffline);

    // ...
}, []);
```

**Solution**: Added an event listener for the "online" event to detect when the user's connection is restored.

**Benefit**: The application can now properly detect both offline and online states, providing a better user experience.

### Fix 2: Initialize with Current Online Status

```javascript
// After: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useState(navigator.onLine);
```

**Solution**: Initialized the `onlineStatus` state with the current online status using `navigator.onLine`.

**Benefit**: The application now correctly reflects the user's network status from the moment it loads, even if the user is already offline.

### Fix 3: Clean Up Event Listeners

```javascript
// After: src/utils/useOnlineStatus.js
useEffect(() => {
    // ...

    // Clean up event listeners when component unmounts
    return () => {
        window.removeEventListener("online", handleOnline);
        window.removeEventListener("offline", handleOffline);
    };
}, []);
```

**Solution**: Added a cleanup function to remove the event listeners when the component unmounts.

**Benefit**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures that event listeners are properly managed throughout the component lifecycle.

## Best Practices for Event Handling in React

1. **Always clean up event listeners**: When adding event listeners in a React component, always remove them when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

2. **Use named functions for event handlers**: Define event handler functions separately instead of using anonymous functions. This makes the code more readable and allows for proper cleanup.

3. **Check initial state**: When dealing with browser APIs like network status, always check the initial state instead of assuming a default value.

4. **Handle both sides of a toggle**: When listening for toggle events (like online/offline), make sure to handle both states to ensure the application behaves correctly in all scenarios.

5. **Test edge cases**: Test your application in various network conditions to ensure it behaves as expected, including loading the application while offline.

## Testing the Solution

To test the offline detection functionality:

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Open the developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Check the "Offline" checkbox to simulate an offline connection
5. Verify that the offline message "Looks like you are offline!! Please Check your internet connection" is displayed
6. Uncheck the "Offline" checkbox to simulate restoring the connection
7. Verify that the application returns to its normal state

## Conclusion

By implementing these changes, the application now correctly detects and responds to changes in the user's network status. The offline message is displayed when the user is offline, and the application returns to its normal state when the connection is restored. This provides a better user experience and helps users understand why the application might not be functioning as expected when they are offline.
