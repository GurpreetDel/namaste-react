# Offline Detection Debugging - Technical Guide

## Issue Description
The application was not displaying the offline message "Looks like you are offline!! Please Check your internet connection" when the user's browser was set to offline mode in the network tab of the developer console.

## Debugging Approach
To debug this issue, we've added comprehensive console.log statements throughout the code to track the online/offline status detection process:

### 1. In useOnlineStatus.js Hook
```javascript
// Log initial online status when hook is initialized
const initialOnlineStatus = navigator.onLine;
console.log("Initial online status:", initialOnlineStatus);

// Log when event listeners are set up
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Setting up online/offline event listeners");
    // ...
}, []);

// Log when online status changes
const handleOnline = () => {
    console.log("User is now ONLINE");
    setOnlineStatus(true);
};

const handleOffline = () => {
    console.log("User is now OFFLINE");
    setOnlineStatus(false);
};

// Log the status being returned by the hook
console.log("Returning online status:", onlineStatus);
return onlineStatus;
```

### 2. In Body.js Component
```javascript
// Log current online status in the component
const onlineStatus = useOnlineStatus();
console.log("Current online status:", onlineStatus);

// Log when offline message is displayed
if(onlineStatus === false) {
    console.log("Displaying offline message to user");
    return <h1>Looks like you are offline!! Please Check your internet connection</h1>
}
```

## How to Test
To test the offline detection functionality:

1. Open the application in a web browser
2. Open the developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Open the browser console to view the log messages
5. Check the "Offline" checkbox to simulate an offline connection
6. Observe the console logs:
   - You should see "User is now OFFLINE" when going offline
   - You should see "Displaying offline message to user" when the offline message is displayed
7. Uncheck the "Offline" checkbox to simulate restoring the connection
8. Observe the console logs:
   - You should see "User is now ONLINE" when going back online

## Expected Console Output
When the application loads:
```
Initial online status: true
Setting up online/offline event listeners
Returning online status: true
Current online status: true
```

When going offline:
```
User is now OFFLINE
Returning online status: false
Current online status: false
Displaying offline message to user
```

When going back online:
```
User is now ONLINE
Returning online status: true
Current online status: true
```

## Troubleshooting
If the offline message is not displayed:
1. Check if the console logs show the correct online status
2. Verify that the event listeners are being set up correctly
3. Make sure the Body component is re-rendering when the online status changes
4. Check if there are any errors in the console

## Conclusion
By adding these console.log statements, we can track the flow of the online/offline status detection and identify any issues in the process. This will help ensure that the offline message is displayed correctly when the user goes offline.
