# Restaurant Menu Display Issue - June 5, 2025

## Problem Description
When clicking on a restaurant card in the application (e.g., Domino's Pizza), the restaurant details were not being displayed correctly. The API response contained the restaurant information, but the application was failing to extract and display this data due to changes in the API response structure.

## API Response Structure Change
The API response structure changed from the previous format. In the new structure, the restaurant name is located at:
```
cards[0].card.card.text: "Domino's Pizza"
```
Instead of the previous path which was:
```
data.cards[0].card.card.info.name
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect State Setting**: The useRestaurantMenu hook was storing only `json.data` in the state, but in the new API structure, the restaurant information is at the root level in `json.cards`.
2. **Rigid Data Access Paths**: The RestaurantMenu component was using hardcoded paths to access data from the API response, which broke when the API structure changed.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Store the Entire API Response**: Updated the useRestaurantMenu hook to store the entire API response in the state, ensuring access to all parts of the data.
   ```javascript
   setResInfo(json); // Instead of setResInfo(json.data)
   ```

2. **Implement Flexible Data Access**: Updated the RestaurantMenu component to check multiple paths for restaurant information, handling both old and new API structures.
   ```javascript
   const restaurantName = 
       resInfo?.cards?.[0]?.card?.card?.text || 
       restaurantInfo?.name || 
       "Restaurant Name Not Available";
   ```

3. **Enhanced Menu Items Extraction**: Implemented multiple paths to find menu items, using a more flexible approach to find the menu card by looking for specific properties.
   ```javascript
   const menuItemsPath3 = resInfo?.cards?.find(card => 
       card?.groupedCard?.cardGroupMap?.REGULAR?.cards
   )?.groupedCard?.cardGroupMap?.REGULAR?.cards;
   ```

4. **Improved UI Rendering**: Updated the UI to use the new variables and provide better fallbacks for missing data, handling different item structures in the menu rendering.
   ```javascript
   <h2>{restaurantName}</h2>
   {restaurantDetails.avgRating && <p>Rating: {restaurantDetails.avgRating}‚≠ê</p>}
   ```

## Results
The changes make the application more resilient to API structure changes. The restaurant name and other details are now correctly displayed, regardless of whether they are in the old or new structure. The component can also handle different menu item structures, ensuring that the menu is displayed correctly.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Store Complete API Responses**: When working with complex or changing APIs, store the entire response to ensure access to all data.
2. **Use Flexible Data Access Patterns**: Implement multiple paths to find data and use feature detection rather than relying on fixed indices.
3. **Provide Fallbacks for Missing Data**: Always handle cases where expected data might be missing or in a different format.
4. **Add Comprehensive Logging**: Include detailed logging to help debug issues with API responses.
5. **Consider API Response Normalization**: For complex applications, consider implementing a normalization layer that converts the API response into a consistent format.

## Future Improvements
1. **API Response Normalization**: Implement a normalization layer that converts the API response into a consistent format before storing it in the state.
2. **Error Boundary Implementation**: Add React Error Boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully at the component level.
3. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to verify that the component handles different API response structures correctly.
