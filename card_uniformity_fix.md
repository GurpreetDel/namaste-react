# Restaurant Card Uniformity Fix

## Problem Description

The restaurant cards in the application were displaying inconsistently when restaurant names and cuisines took up more space. This caused several issues:

1. **Star ratings became invisible** on cards with longer restaurant names or cuisine lists
2. **ETA delivery time was not visible** on some cards
3. **Cost for two information was completely hidden** on certain cards
4. **Offer section was not visible** on cards with longer text content
5. **Horizontal line was not consistent** across all cards

These inconsistencies created a disjointed user experience that did not match the uniform appearance of the original Swiggy.com website.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the codebase, we identified the following issues:

1. **Variable Height for Restaurant Name**:
   - The restaurant name (h3) used `whiteSpace: "normal"` which allowed text to wrap to multiple lines
   - It had `minHeight: "24px"` instead of a fixed height, allowing it to expand vertically
   - Longer restaurant names would take up more vertical space, pushing other elements down

2. **Lack of Container for Text Elements**:
   - The restaurant name and cuisine sections didn't have a containing element with a fixed height
   - This allowed their combined height to vary based on content length

3. **Cascading Layout Issues**:
   - When the name and cuisine sections expanded, they pushed the metadata section (ratings, ETA, cost, offers) down
   - This could cause the metadata to be partially or completely hidden, especially on cards with longer text content

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to ensure consistent display across all restaurant cards:

### 1. Fixed Restaurant Name Display

```jsx
<h3 style={{
    margin: "6px 12px 2px 12px",
    fontSize: "18px",
    fontWeight: "600",
    color: "#3e4152",
    lineHeight: "24px",
    overflow: "hidden",
    textOverflow: "ellipsis",
    whiteSpace: "nowrap", // Changed from "normal" to "nowrap" to prevent wrapping
    height: "24px", // Changed from minHeight to fixed height
}}>
    {resData && resData.info ? resData.info.name : "Restaurant Name"}
</h3>
```

- Changed `whiteSpace` from "normal" to "nowrap" to prevent text wrapping
- Changed `minHeight` to a fixed `height` of 24px to ensure consistent height
- This ensures that restaurant names are displayed on a single line with ellipsis if too long

### 2. Added Container for Text Elements

```jsx
<div style={{
    height: "54px", // Fixed height for name and cuisine container (24px + 20px + margins)
    padding: "0",
    margin: "0",
    overflow: "hidden" // Ensure nothing overflows
}}>
    <h3>...</h3>
    <h4>...</h4>
</div>
```

- Added a container div around the restaurant name and cuisine elements
- Set a fixed height of 54px (24px for name + 20px for cuisine + margins)
- Added `overflow: "hidden"` to ensure nothing overflows the container
- This ensures that the name and cuisine sections always take up exactly the same amount of vertical space

## Before and After Comparison

### Before:
- Restaurant names could wrap to multiple lines, taking up variable space
- Cuisine lists could push other elements down
- Star ratings, ETA delivery time, and cost for two were sometimes hidden
- Offer information was often not visible on cards with longer text content
- Horizontal lines appeared at different positions in different cards

### After:
- All restaurant names are displayed on a single line with ellipsis if too long
- Cuisine lists are consistently displayed on a single line
- Star ratings, ETA delivery time, and cost for two are always visible
- Offer information is always visible
- Horizontal lines appear at the same position across all cards

## Technical Implementation Details

The implementation required careful consideration of the following factors:

1. **Fixed Heights**: Fixed heights were added to all sections to ensure consistent layout:
   - Restaurant name: 24px
   - Cuisine: 20px
   - Name and cuisine container: 54px
   - Metadata section: 70px (unchanged from previous implementation)

2. **Text Truncation**: All text elements now have consistent truncation with ellipsis:
   - `whiteSpace: "nowrap"`
   - `overflow: "hidden"`
   - `textOverflow: "ellipsis"`

3. **Container-Based Layout**: By adding a container for the text elements, we ensure that they always take up the same amount of vertical space, regardless of content length.

## Conclusion

The implemented changes successfully address the inconsistencies in the restaurant cards when restaurant names and cuisines take up more space. All cards now display star ratings, ETA delivery time, cost for two, and offer information consistently, creating a uniform appearance that matches the original Swiggy.com website.

This enhancement improves the overall user experience by providing a consistent and professional look to the restaurant listing page, ensuring that all important information is visible and properly formatted regardless of the length of restaurant names or cuisine lists.
