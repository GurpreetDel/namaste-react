## Comparison with Swiggy Website

The styled components now closely resemble the Swiggy website in terms of:

1. Overall layout and structure
2. Color scheme and typography
3. Card design and information presentation
4. Interactive elements and animations
5. Responsive behavior

## Testing

The styling can be tested by running the application and comparing it with the official Swiggy website. The application should now closely resemble the Swiggy website's design in terms of layout, colors, and overall user experience.

## Next Steps

To further enhance the Swiggy-like experience:

1. Implement additional pages like restaurant details, checkout, etc.
2. Add more interactive elements like carousels and filters
3. Implement animations for page transitions
4. Add more responsive design elements for different devices
5. Implement dark mode support
