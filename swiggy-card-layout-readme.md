# Swiggy Restaurant Card Layout Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive styling updates made to make the restaurant cards layout look exactly like the official Swiggy website (https://www.swiggy.com/restaurants), focusing on creating a more compact and polished grid layout.

## Key Issues Addressed
1. Restaurant cards were too large and not properly sized
2. Grid layout was not matching Swiggy's compact design
3. Too many cards per row on large screens (5 instead of 4)
4. Spacing between cards was too large
5. Container width was too wide

## Components Updated

### 1. Body Component
- **Container Width**
  - Reduced the container width from `max-w-6xl` to `max-w-5xl` for a more compact layout
  - This ensures the cards are displayed in a grid that matches Swiggy's design

- **Grid Layout**
  - Changed the grid columns from `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5` to `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-4`
  - This ensures that on large screens, there will be 4 columns instead of 5, matching Swiggy's layout
  - Reduced the gap between cards from `gap-3` (0.75rem) to `gap-2` (0.5rem) for a more compact layout

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-2">
    {filteredRestaurants.map((restaurant, index) => (
        <Link 
            key={restaurant.info.id}
            to={"/restaurants/"+restaurant.info.id}
            className="block transition-transform duration-200 hover:-translate-y-0.5"
        >
            <RestaurantCard resData={restaurant} />
        </Link>
    ))}
</div>
```

### 2. RestaurantCard Component
- **Card Design**
  - Changed the card from `rounded-lg` to just `rounded` for less pronounced corners
  - Reduced the shadow from `shadow-sm` to `shadow-xs` for a more subtle look
  - Made the hover effect more subtle with a smaller shadow increase

- **Image Size**
  - Reduced the image height from `h-40` (160px) to `h-36` (144px) to match Swiggy's compact card design

- **Typography and Spacing**
  - Reduced the padding from `p-2` to `p-1.5` for a more compact layout
  - Reduced the font size for the restaurant name from `text-base` to `text-sm`
  - Reduced the spacing between elements (mt-2 to mt-1.5, pt-2 to pt-1.5)
  - Made the discount banner smaller with less padding (`p-1` to `p-0.5`)
  - Made the discount text smaller (`text-sm` to `text-xs`)

- **Quick View Button**
  - Made the button smaller with less padding (`py-1` to `py-0.5`)
  - Reduced the icon size from `w-3 h-3` to `w-2.5 h-2.5`
  - Reduced the spacing between the icon and text (`mr-1` to `mr-0.5`)

```jsx
<div className="bg-white rounded overflow-hidden shadow-xs hover:shadow-sm transition-shadow duration-200">
    {/* Restaurant Image */}
    <div className="relative">
        <img
            src={imageUrl}
            alt={name}
            className="w-full h-36 object-cover"
        />
        
        {/* Discount Banner */}
        {discount && (
            <div className="absolute bottom-0 w-full bg-gradient-to-t from-black to-transparent p-0.5">
                <p className="text-white font-bold text-xs">{discount}</p>
            </div>
        )}
    </div>
    
    {/* Restaurant Info */}
    <div className="p-1.5">
        {/* Content */}
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Shimmer Component
- **Container Width**
  - Updated the container width to match Body.js (`max-w-6xl` to `max-w-5xl`)

- **Grid Layout**
  - Updated the grid layout to match Body.js
  - Increased the number of shimmer cards from 15 to 16 to better fill the grid

- **Card Design**
  - Updated the card styling to match RestaurantCard.js
  - Reduced the image height to match RestaurantCard.js
  - Adjusted the heights of the shimmer elements to match the smaller text sizes

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-2">
    {Array(16).fill("").map((_, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="bg-white rounded overflow-hidden shadow-xs">
            {/* Shimmer content */}
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
```

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Compact Layout
- Reduced container width for a more focused layout
- Reduced padding and margins throughout the cards
- Made font sizes smaller and more appropriate for each element
- Ensured consistent 4 columns on larger screens

### 2. Subtle Visual Elements
- Reduced shadow intensity for a cleaner look
- Made rounded corners less pronounced
- Made hover effects more subtle
- Reduced the visual weight of elements like the discount banner and quick view button

### 3. Consistent Spacing
- Applied consistent spacing between elements
- Used smaller gaps between grid items
- Maintained proper hierarchy with appropriate spacing

### 4. Responsive Design
- Ensured the design works well on all screen sizes
- Used appropriate grid layouts for different breakpoints
- Maintained the same number of columns as Swiggy at each breakpoint

## Comparison with Swiggy Website
The updated design now closely resembles the Swiggy website in terms of:
1. Overall layout and density of content
2. Card sizes and spacing
3. Number of cards per row at different screen sizes
4. Typography scale and hierarchy
5. Visual elements like shadows and rounded corners

## Testing
The styling can be tested by running the application and comparing it with the official Swiggy website. The application should now closely resemble the Swiggy website's design in terms of layout, card sizes, and overall visual appearance.

## Next Steps
To further enhance the Swiggy-like experience:
1. Implement category filters with horizontal scrolling
2. Add "What's on your mind?" carousel section
3. Implement restaurant collections
4. Add sorting options (Relevance, Delivery Time, Rating, etc.)
5. Implement responsive images with different sizes for different devices
