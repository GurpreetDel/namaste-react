# Fixing Destructuring Syntax in RestaurantMenu.js

## The Issue

In the `RestaurantMenu.js` file, there was an issue with the destructuring syntax on line 22:

```javascript
const { costForTwoMessage } = resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info?.costForTwoMessage;
```

This line was attempting to destructure a property called `costForTwoMessage` from the value of `resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info?.costForTwoMessage`, which is incorrect. The right side of this assignment is already accessing the `costForTwoMessage` property, not an object from which we can destructure.

## The Solution

The correct way to handle this is to simply assign the value directly to a variable:

```javascript
const costForTwoMessage = resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info?.costForTwoMessage;
```

This assigns the value of the `costForTwoMessage` property to a variable with the same name.

## Understanding JavaScript Destructuring

Destructuring is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a more concise way.

### Correct Destructuring Examples:

1. **Object Destructuring:**
   ```javascript
   // From an object
   const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
   const { name, age } = person;
   // name = 'John', age = 30
   ```

2. **With Optional Chaining:**
   ```javascript
   // From a nested object with optional chaining
   const { name, cuisines, costForTwoMessage } = resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info;
   ```

3. **With Default Values:**
   ```javascript
   // With default values
   const { name = 'Unknown', age = 0 } = person;
   ```

4. **Renaming Variables:**
   ```javascript
   // Renaming variables
   const { name: fullName, age: years } = person;
   // fullName = 'John', years = 30
   ```

### Incorrect Destructuring (What Was Fixed):

```javascript
// INCORRECT: Trying to destructure from a value, not an object
const { costForTwoMessage } = resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info?.costForTwoMessage;
```

The issue here is that `resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info?.costForTwoMessage` is already accessing the property value (a string like "â‚¹200 for two"), not an object. You can't destructure properties from a primitive value like a string.

## Summary

The fix was to change the destructuring syntax to a simple assignment, which correctly assigns the value of the `costForTwoMessage` property to a variable with the same name.

If you wanted to use destructuring properly, you could have done:

```javascript
const { costForTwoMessage } = resInfo?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.info;
```

This would destructure the `costForTwoMessage` property from the `info` object.
