# Swiggy Website Styling Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive styling updates made to make the application look more like the official Swiggy website (https://www.swiggy.com/restaurants), focusing on fixing layout issues and making the design more compact and polished.

## Key Issues Addressed
1. Restaurant cards were too large and not properly visible
2. Header elements were not properly centered and were positioned in the right corner
3. Overall layout was not matching the Swiggy website's compact design

## Components Updated

### 1. Header Component
- **Alignment and Spacing**
  - Reduced spacing between navigation items from `space-x-10` to `space-x-4`
  - Removed unnecessary navigation items to match Swiggy's design
  - Made the font sizes smaller with `text-sm` instead of the default size
  - Reduced the icon sizes from 19px to 17px
  - Made the online status indicator smaller
  - Made the cart badge smaller

```jsx
<div className="flex items-center">
    <ul className="flex items-center space-x-4">
        <li className="flex items-center text-gray-700 hover:text-orange-500 cursor-pointer">
            <span className="mr-1">
                <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="17" width="17" fill="currentColor">
                    <!-- SVG path -->
                </svg>
            </span>
            <span className="text-sm font-medium">Search</span>
        </li>
        <!-- Other navigation items -->
    </ul>
</div>
```

### 2. RestaurantCard Component
- **Size and Layout**
  - Reduced the image height from `h-52` (208px) to `h-40` (160px)
  - Reduced the padding from `p-3` to `p-2`
  - Made the font sizes smaller (text-lg to text-base for name, text-sm to text-xs for cuisines)
  - Made the rating badge smaller with less padding
  - Reduced the spacing between elements
  - Made the "QUICK VIEW" button smaller and less prominent
  - Changed the card from rounded-2xl to rounded-lg for a more subtle look
  - Reduced the shadow from shadow-md to shadow-sm for a more subtle look

```jsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm hover:shadow transition-shadow duration-200">
    <!-- Restaurant Image -->
    <div className="relative">
        <img
            src={imageUrl}
            alt={name}
            className="w-full h-40 object-cover"
        />
        <!-- Discount Banner -->
    </div>
    
    <!-- Restaurant Info -->
    <div className="p-2">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Body Component
- **Grid Layout and Spacing**
  - Increased the number of columns (now 2 on mobile, 3 on small screens, 4 on medium screens, and 5 on large screens)
  - Reduced the gap between cards from `gap-6` to `gap-3`
  - Made the hover effect more subtle with `hover:-translate-y-0.5` instead of `hover:-translate-y-1`
  - Made the search and filter section more compact
  - Reduced the margin-bottom of the restaurant heading from `mb-6` to `mb-4`
  - Reduced the font size of the restaurant heading from `text-2xl` to `text-xl`

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-3">
    {filteredRestaurants.map((restaurant, index) => (
        <Link 
            key={restaurant.info.id}
            to={"/restaurants/"+restaurant.info.id}
            className="block transition-transform duration-200 hover:-translate-y-0.5"
        >
            <RestaurantCard resData={restaurant} />
        </Link>
    ))}
</div>
```

### 4. Shimmer Component
- **Matching the Updated Design**
  - Updated the search and filter section to match the Body.js component
  - Updated the restaurant cards grid to match the Body.js component
  - Updated the shimmer card design to match the RestaurantCard.js component
  - Increased the number of shimmer cards from 12 to 15 to fill the grid better

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-3">
    {Array(15).fill("").map((_, index) => (
        <div key={index} className="bg-white rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-sm">
            <!-- Shimmer content -->
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
```

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Compact Layout
- Reduced padding and margins throughout the application
- Made font sizes smaller and more appropriate for each element
- Increased the number of columns to show more content in the same space

### 2. Subtle Visual Elements
- Reduced shadow intensity for a cleaner look
- Made rounded corners less pronounced
- Made hover effects more subtle

### 3. Consistent Spacing
- Applied consistent spacing between elements
- Used smaller gaps between grid items
- Maintained proper hierarchy with appropriate spacing

### 4. Responsive Design
- Ensured the design works well on all screen sizes
- Used appropriate grid layouts for different breakpoints
- Made the search and filter section stack properly on mobile

## Comparison with Swiggy Website
The updated design now closely resembles the Swiggy website in terms of:
1. Overall layout and density of content
2. Card sizes and spacing
3. Typography scale and hierarchy
4. Visual elements like shadows and rounded corners
5. Interactive elements like hover effects

## Testing
The styling can be tested by running the application and comparing it with the official Swiggy website. The application should now closely resemble the Swiggy website's design in terms of layout, card sizes, and overall visual appearance.

## Next Steps
To further enhance the Swiggy-like experience:
1. Implement additional features like sorting options
2. Add category filters with horizontal scrolling
3. Implement a sticky header for the filter section
4. Add animations for loading and transitions
5. Implement responsive images with different sizes for different devices
